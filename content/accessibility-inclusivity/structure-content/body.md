<h2 id="section1" class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-xl">
  Paragraphs
</h2>

Use short, simple paragraphs.

Limit paragraphs to 2 or 3 sentences containing 1 idea. Or break text up into bullet point lists.

Allow for lots of white space.

<h4>Examples</h4>

  Headings and subheadings
</h2>

The user should be able to get an understanding of the content by scanning the headings.

### Make the title short and accurate

Write a clear title and lead summary. Tell the user what the page is about and who it’s for.
Headings are the first words users read to check the relevance of content before they commit to reading it.

Make headings short and succinct enough to stand alone when read out of context, for example in search results and on social media.

Google searches only show 55 characters of the page title.

Use only 1 top level (H1) heading.

### Break up content with subheadings

Users lose track if there are too many heading levels.

Break up blocks of text and draw the reader in with short interesting headings.

Help the user to understand the relationship between sections of text.

Short content should only use 2 subheading levels (H2 and H3).

On the average web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an average visit; 20% is more likely.

### Front load keywords in headings

Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help the user to make a connection.

This will also help search engines find your content.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Digital communities of practice  
Smart cities in Europe  
</article>

Avoid meaningless words such as ‘more’ and ‘related information’. State what the paragraph says.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:
Smart cities in Europe
<br>
Not this:
More information
</article>

<h2 id="section3" class="au-display-xl">
  Hyperlinks
</h2>

Use precise link text

Make the destination of the link clear.

Think about the user and their context when reading the information. Be helpful.

Don’t use meaningless terms such as ‘click here’, ‘read more’ or ‘useful links’.

Don’t make the link text too long. Only link the keywords.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>

Do this:  
Attend next month’s workshop for developers and writers in Brisbane.  
<br>
Not this:  
Attend a Brisbane workshop for developers and writers next month.  
<br>
Never this:  
Attend a Brisbane workshop for developers and writers next month.  
Click here for more information.  
</article>

### Place links carefully
Add links wherever they are most useful to the user.

Embed links in paragraphs to help the user scan for the information they need.

Be careful of overcrowding paragraphs with links as this can affect readability.

Grouping links together at the bottom of a page can disrupt readability too. Users may skip the text and just read the links.

### Make calls to actions (CTAs) accurate and prominent

Use keywords the user will understand that accurately describe the action.

### Use the email address as the link

Hyperlink all email addresses.

Use the ```mailto:``` prefix in the HTMLbut not in the link text.
