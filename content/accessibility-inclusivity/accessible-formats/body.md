# Choose accessible formats

<p class="componentheader__body abstract">
Plan to create accessible content from the start, whether you’re writing a policy, publishing a news story, making a video or guiding users through a transaction.
<br/><br/>
Everyone involved from creation through to publishing is responsible for ensuring accessibility. Senior executives, managers, subject matter experts, online content experts and publishing teams each play a role and should know the risks of not complying.

  Use HTML as the default
</h2>

HTML is the default format for all government information. 
When choosing formats, adopt the practice of creating a web page in the first instance. 

Web content is usually published within a content management system (CMS) that has inbuilt styles that help content authors to conform with accessibility.

  Push back on PDFs
</h2>

When we put the user first, we ask on their behalf if a PDF is really how they need to access the information. 

PDFs are not accessible on mobile devices. People need to use a desktop or laptop to use assistive technologies to read PDFs. 

It’s difficult for many users to access PDFs on smaller screens as they don’t resize and reformat to fit the screen.

### Offer an alternative format to PDF

When there is a strong evidence of a user need to have content available in PDFs, you must first publish the content in HTML. The non-HTML format is published as secondary information. 

If you are relying on PDF as the accessible format, then the document needs a HTML landing page. 

The landing page should contain an overview of the document and outcomes, as relevant. 

Provide a contact (an email address) so users can request the information in a different format.

  Create accessible images
</h2>

### General rules

1. Choose relevant and clear images that usefully add to the text content
2. Ensure the images are not culturally insensitive to any audience
3. Ensure there is sufficient contrast between any text and the background in images.
4. Create descriptive alternative text for images
5. Create contextual captions for images that are different from alt-text
