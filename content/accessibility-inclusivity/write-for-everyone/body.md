  Why write for everyone
</h2> -->

Clear writing and using common words (plain English) helps everyone to understand, regardless of their ability, including:

- people who use screen readers
- people who have low literacy levels
- people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
- specialist and technical audiences

Using plain English doesn’t mean ‘dumbing down’ information. If you’re writing for a specialist audience or multiple audiences, you still need to make sure everyone can understand what the content is about. Plain English helps people make decisions and builds trust. It’s also easier to translate. 

<h2 id="section2" class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-xl">
  Write for your audience
</h2>

Your writing will be most effective if you understand who you’re writing for.

To understand your audience you should research:
- behaviour — what the user is interested in or worried about, so your writing will  answer their questions
- vocabulary — so that you can use the same terms and phrases they will use to search for information


<h2 id="section3" class="au-display-xl">
  Government tone
</h2>

The modern government tone is direct, calm and understated.

Be polite and use language that is positive, sensitive and respectful.

<h2 id="section4" class="au-display-xl">
  Rules for creating readable and inclusive content
</h2>

### Aim for age 9 reading level

Content with a good readability level helps users know what to do. This includes users with lower comprehension skills.

We recommend you aim for age 9 readability level (Australian Year 3 or Year 4). Don’t go above a lower high school reading level.

WCAG criteria 3.1.5 (level AAA) requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles (between 12 to 14 years old).

</p>

### Avoid jargon and use simple, direct language

Using plain language helps the user to understand the content the first time they read it. Explain unusual words by providing a glossary.

### Use active voice

Active voice (subject-verb-object) gets straight to the point.

Avoid passive voice (object-verb-subject). 

Passive voice usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom and sends the reader backwards.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:  
The committee (subject) campaigned (verb) to lower diabetes (object).  
We (subject) did not accept (verb) your application (object).  
<br/><br/>
Not this:  
The lowering of diabetes was campaigned for by the committee.  
It was deemed your application was unsuccessful.  
</article>

### Minimise punctuation 

Use several short sentences instead of a long sentence broken up with punctuation.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
[INSERT  EXAMPLE HERE}
</article>

### Use first and second person

Use first and second pronouns (I, we, us and you) to establish a connection with the user.

Avoid third person nouns (Australian Government Department of X) and pronouns (he, she, it and they).

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:  
Tell us if you have trouble with your account.  
<br/><br/>
Not this:  
If the subscriber is having difficulty accessing their account, the finance team can provide further guidance.
</article>

### Avoid gendered pronouns

Rewrite the sentence to avoid using gender-specific singular pronouns (he/she, her/his, her/him).

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:  
Submit your employment declaration.
<br/><br/>
Not this:  
Every employee should submit his employment declaration.
</article>

### Speak to the person, not their difference

Avoid discriminatory language that treats some people differently from others. 

<p class="au-callout">

18.3% of Australians live with a disability affecting their daily activities. 
<br><br>
More than half of Australians aged 65 and over live with disability. 
<br><br>
420,300 Australians are aged 85 years or over. It will rise to 3.5 million people by 2069.
</p>

Speak to the person in plain English without jargon. This avoids getting caught up in semantics and is respectful of:
- disability
- cultural differences
- differences in socioeconomic background
- differences in educational levels and systems
- generational differences
- gender roles
- perceptions of social and support concepts
- political impacts on life events
- pre and post effects of wars
- religious affiliations
- values or philosophical differences

<h2 id="section5" class="au-display-xl">
  Languages other than English
</h2>


Make sure your content can be understood by someone who speaks English as a second, third or fourth language.

<p class="au-callout">

27% of Australia’s 22 million people were born overseas.  
<br>
46% of Australians have at least 1 parent who was born overseas.  
<br>
19% of Australians speak a language other than English at home.  
<br>
60% of Australia’s population growth in 2013 was from overseas migration.  
</p>

Find out if there is a user need to provide the content in other community languages.This can be important if there are compliance requirements or health and safety issues.

Research with users to find out which languages they need to read the information in. Don’t just pick the top languages spoken at home, or another simple metric. These can be misleading about real user needs.

### Plain English is easier to translate

Write the content in plain English first. This makes it easier to translate, and to read when translated.

Content should also be culturally sensitive to people who come from different cultures and may have different expectations of dealing with government.

### Translate the cultural context

Translating is not just about the literal words. It’s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

### Use an accredited translator

It is best practice to use an NAATI-accredited translator. Then ask another accredited translator to check it.

### Make all translated formats accessible

Make sure the format of the translated content is accessible.
If there is a user need for a PDF of the translated content you must:
- make the plain English version available in HTML
- make the content in PDFs accessible

<h2 id="section6" class="au-display-xl">
  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
</h2>

<p class="au-callout">
3% of Australians identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples.
</p>

The terms ‘First Australians’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ (note the plural) include distinct and diverse cultural groups. These terms do not represent the same group.

Don’t use:
- Aboriginals, Aborigine — these words are associated with colonisation and assimilation and are distressing to many people
- ATSI — never use the acronym ATSI as this is considered disrespectful
- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians

Use the correct language group name if possible

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ngunnawal woman spoke first.</li>
    <li>We wish to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land we are meeting on, the Ngunnawal people.</li>
  </ul>
</article>

### Preferred terms for referring to First Australians

Use ‘First Australians’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ (note the plural) if you are not sure of the local language group or are talking about multiple groups.

First Australian is not generally used in reference to an individual.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>More than 1000 First Australians were employed through the program.</li>
    <li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have distinct identities, histories and cultural traditions.</li>
  </ul>
</article>

If appropriate you can use the terms ‘Aboriginal peoples’ and ‘Torres Strait Islander people’ on their own.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Aboriginal flag was created as a symbol of unity and national identity for Aboriginal peoples during the land rights movement of the early 1970s.</li>
    <li>Aboriginal Elder.</li>
    <li>The Torres Strait Islander flag was created as a symbol of unity and identity for Torres Strait Islander peoples.</li>
    <li>Torres Strait Islander child/woman/man.</li>
  </ul>
</article>

### Be careful using the word ‘Indigenous’

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many First Australians.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function.
Indigenous should always be capitalised.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Indigenous Specialist Officer</li>
    <li>Indigenous Services Branch</li>
  </ul>
</article>

### Writing for First Australian audiences

Remember that English can be a second, third or even fourth language for many First Australians.

Make sure of the context and relevance before using First Australian cultural terms.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First Peoples</li>
    <li>On Country</li>
    <li>Sorry Business</li>
    <li>Men’s Business</li>
    <li>Women’s Business</li>
    <li>Traditional Owners or Traditional Custodians</li>
  </ul>
</article>
