# Why aim for age 9 reading?

When most people reach age 9 reading level the way they read content has changed.

By 9 years old most children stop reading whole words and start reading by recognising shapes. This allows people to read much faster.

Most readers don’t read single words in order. They bounce backwards and forwards, especially online. They expect words and fill them in.

An adult brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand the content.

When a user reaches a word or phrase that is unfamiliar or difficult it slows down their understanding. If they experience too much of this they lose confidence in the content and may give up.

A person’s vocabulary will grow as they age but the shape-recognition skill stays with them.

## How to measure reading levels
### Flesch reading ease

The ‘Flesch reading ease’ index is a common measure for content. Many readability tools use it. The index is a scale from 1 to 100. A higher score is easier to read.

A score of 100 on the Flesch reading ease index should be readable by someone who reads at US school Grade 5 level. This is an age 10 to 11 reading level. But it’s better to aim for age 9 (between US Grade 3 and Grade 4).

There are other popular scales used by readability tools. For example, Hemmingway Editor uses the automated readability index, which is also based on US school grade.

### Use readability tools with care

Readability tools can show where you can improve content. They can also give you useful metrics to use to suggest changes to stakeholders.

Readability tools often use US school grades as a guide. These are different to Australian grades, so it can better to talk about age instead.
Some tools give suggestions to make text more readable. Be careful using automatic recommendations. Sometimes the user will be more familiar with a longer keyword.

## Don’t just test the reading level
As well as readability, you need to test:
- findability — can users easily find it?
- comprehension — can users understand it?
- engagement — do users read enough of it to understand or skim over it?
- effectiveness — does it provide the right information/answers and cover what the user needs to know?
