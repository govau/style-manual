# Why create inclusive and accessible content? 

<p class="componentheader__body abstract">
Australia is a diverse country that includes people of various cultures, languages, abilities and ages. If you are creating content for government information and services, you must ensure it is accessible and inclusive.

  Benefits of accessible content

Accessibility is a basic human right. It is against the law to be discriminated against in many areas of public life, including employment, education, the provision of goods, services and facilities, accommodation, sport and the administration of Commonwealth laws and services (Source: [Australian Human Rights Commission](#)) 

The people who most need government services and information often find them the hardest to understand and use. 

There are benefits to both government and society in getting it right.

### Benefits to society
Greater participation in society for: 
- people with disabilities
- people with low literacy
- older users 
- mobile device users
- people from non-English speaking backgrounds

Benefits to government
- reduced legal risk
- financial savings (for example reduced call costs where applicable)
- demonstrating social responsibility for users
- easier translation for culturally and linguistically diverse audiences if required
- reduced legal risk of receiving complaints through the Human Rights Commission
- better search engine optimisation (plain language helps with search results)

</h2>

Government agencies that don’t meet accessibility requirements risk being reported to the [Australian Human Rights Commission](#) and attracting negative public and media attention.

The Commission investigates and resolves complaints of discrimination based on a person’s:
- [sex](#), [gender identity](#),  [intersex status](#) and [sexual orientation](#)
- [disability](#), including temporary and permanent disabilities; physical, intellectual, sensory, psychiatric disabilities, diseases or illnesses; medical conditions; work related injuries; past, present and future disabilities; and association with a person with a disability
- [race](#), including colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, immigrant status and racial hatred
- [age](#), covering young people and older people

The Commission reports on Australia’s progress against the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disability on a regular basis.

<h2 class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-xl">
  Digital Service Standard (the Standard)
  <a id="section3" class="au-inpage-nav-section-link" href="#section1">Link to section</a>
</h2>

If you are creating new government services or redeveloping existing services, you need to ensure they accessible to all users to meet [Criteria 9 of the Standard](#). 

Government services must be available to users regardless of their location and level of all digital confidence. This includes users in remote areas and using’ different devices. 

To meet the Standard, you need to meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)](#). 

There are 38 criteria that apply at level AA. We also recommend some of the level AAA criteria. Content authors are typically  responsible for 17 criteria (outlined in our guidance).

WCAG 2.1 is expected to be released mid 2018 and will include  more cognitive impairment and low-vision issues. Read the [working draft of WCAG 2.1](#).
