## Numbers and measurements 

__[agency co-attribution component] Vision Australia co-developed this content with the Digital Transformation Agency.__

### _The rule_
Use digits instead of words for most numbers. This makes numbers easier to read on a screen.

Add a comma between the third and fourth digit from the right, for numbers 10,000 and above.

Use words for:
common expressions where digits would look strange — for example, ‘one or two of them’
ordinals (first, second) but not dates and date periods (19th century)
use the word million instead of digits.

__[example component] Examples__  
*1 to 9 — not one to nine*  
*one or two of them*  
*10 to 9999*  
*10,000 to 1 million*  
*first, second, third*  
*100s of them*  
*5kg*  
*50KB*  
*10am*  
*$2*  
*75%*  
*Section 10*  
*19th century*  
*1980s*  
*25 people went to the launch*  

### *Rationale component* - Why it’s easier to read numbers on screen 
Insert some facts/research about why it is easier for people to read numbers vs words on a screen.

### Guidance on abbreviating large numbers

Abbreviate thousand, million, billion and trillion in headings, tables and graphics.

__[example component] Examples__  
*1k*  
*2m*  
*3bn*  
*4tn*  

### Guidance on using digits at the beginning of a line, bulleted item or sentence

Use digits at the beginning of a line, bulleted item or sentence.

__[example component] Examples__  
*We are cataloging the collection. 19th century works of art are the focus.*

### Guidance on punctuating dates 

Don’t punctuate dates.
__[example component] Examples__  
*Like this: Tuesday 8 October 2016*  
*Not this: 8th October, 2016*  

### Guidance on date periods 

Use numbers for date periods.

__[example component] Examples__  
*Like this: 19th century*  
*Not this: Nineteenth century*  

### Guidance on punctuating date ranges

Use ‘to’ in time and date ranges — not hyphens or en dashes.

__[example component] Examples__  
*We are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.*  
*This will take 10 to 15 minutes.*  
*We published the annual report for the 2015 to 2016 financial year.*  

### Guidance on spacing phone numbers 

Use spaces to help people read phone numbers.

__[example component] Examples__  
*02 5550 0000 — interstate phone numbers, not (02) 5550 0000*  
*61 2 7010 0000 — Australian landline numbers dialed from overseas*  
*0491 570 156 — mobile numbers*  
*61 491 570 156 — Australian mobile numbers dialed from overseas*  
*1300 975 707 or 1800 160 401 or 1900 654 321 — 10 digit numbers*  
*13 13 13 — 6 digit numbers*  

### Guidance on linking phone numbers 

Use a link to allow users on a mobile device to call phone numbers.

Use `tel:[phone number]` as the URL. Remove spaces between the numbers.

Remember all web pages can be accessed internationally. Include the international dialling prefix if appropriate.
