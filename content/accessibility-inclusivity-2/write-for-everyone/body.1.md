  Why write for everyone
</h2>

Clear writing and using common words (plain English) helps everyone to understand, regardless of their ability, including:

- people who use screen readers
- people who have low literacy levels
- people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
- specialist and technical audiences

Using plain English doesn’t mean ‘dumbing down’ information. If you’re writing for a specialist audience or multiple audiences, you still need to make sure everyone can understand what the content is about. Plain English helps people make decisions and builds trust. It’s also easier to translate. 

<h2 id="section2" class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-xl">
  Write for your audience
</h2>

Your writing will be most effective if you understand who you’re writing for.

To understand your audience you should research:
- behaviour — what the user is interested in or worried about, so your writing will  answer their questions
- vocabulary — so that you can use the same terms and phrases they will use to search for information


<h2 id="section3" class="au-display-xl">
  Government tone
</h2>

The modern government tone is direct, calm and understated.

Be polite and use language that is positive, sensitive and respectful.
