  Rules for creating readable and inclusive content
</h2>

### Aim for age 9 reading level

Content with a good readability level helps users know what to do. This includes users with lower comprehension skills.

We recommend you aim for age 9 readability level (Australian Year 3 or Year 4). Donâ€™t go above a lower high school reading level.

WCAG criteria 3.1.5 (level AAA) requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles (between 12 to 14 years old).

### Avoid jargon and use simple, direct language

Using plain language helps the user to understand the content the first time they read it. Explain unusual words by providing a glossary.

### Use active voice

Active voice (subject-verb-object) gets straight to the point.

Avoid passive voice (object-verb-subject). 

Passive voice usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom and sends the reader backwards.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:  
The committee (subject) campaigned (verb) to lower diabetes (object).  
We (subject) did not accept (verb) your application (object).  
<br/><br/>
Not this:  
The lowering of diabetes was campaigned for by the committee.  
It was deemed your application was unsuccessful.  
</article>

### Minimise punctuation 

Use several short sentences instead of a long sentence broken up with punctuation.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
[INSERT  EXAMPLE HERE}
</article>

### Use first and second person

Use first and second pronouns (I, we, us and you) to establish a connection with the user.

Avoid third person nouns (Australian Government Department of X) and pronouns (he, she, it and they).

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:  
Tell us if you have trouble with your account.  
<br/><br/>
Not this:  
If the subscriber is having difficulty accessing their account, the finance team can provide further guidance.
</article>

### Avoid gendered pronouns

Rewrite the sentence to avoid using gender-specific singular pronouns (he/she, her/his, her/him).

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:  
Submit your employment declaration.
<br/><br/>
Not this:  
Every employee should submit his employment declaration.
</article>

### Speak to the person, not their difference

Avoid discriminatory language that treats some people differently from others. 

<p class="au-callout">

18.3% of Australians live with a disability affecting their daily activities. 
<br><br>
More than half of Australians aged 65 and over live with disability. 
<br><br>
420,300 Australians are aged 85 years or over. It will rise to 3.5 million people by 2069.
</p>

Speak to the person in plain English without jargon. This avoids getting caught up in semantics and is respectful of:
- disability
- cultural differences
- differences in socioeconomic background
- differences in educational levels and systems
- generational differences
- gender roles
- perceptions of social and support concepts
- political impacts on life events
- pre and post effects of wars
- religious affiliations
- values or philosophical differences
