  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
</h2>

<p class="au-callout">
3% of Australians identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples.
</p>

The terms ‘First Australians’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ (note the plural) include distinct and diverse cultural groups. These terms do not represent the same group.

Don’t use:
- Aboriginals, Aborigine — these words are associated with colonisation and assimilation and are distressing to many people
- ATSI — never use the acronym ATSI as this is considered disrespectful
- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians

Use the correct language group name if possible

<br>

<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ngunnawal woman spoke first.</li>
    <li>We wish to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land we are meeting on, the Ngunnawal people.</li>
  </ul>
</article>

### Preferred terms for referring to First Australians

Use ‘First Australians’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ (note the plural) if you are not sure of the local language group or are talking about multiple groups.

First Australian is not generally used in reference to an individual.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>More than 1000 First Australians were employed through the program.</li>
    <li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have distinct identities, histories and cultural traditions.</li>
  </ul>
</article>

If appropriate you can use the terms ‘Aboriginal peoples’ and ‘Torres Strait Islander people’ on their own.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Aboriginal flag was created as a symbol of unity and national identity for Aboriginal peoples during the land rights movement of the early 1970s.</li>
    <li>Aboriginal Elder.</li>
    <li>The Torres Strait Islander flag was created as a symbol of unity and identity for Torres Strait Islander peoples.</li>
    <li>Torres Strait Islander child/woman/man.</li>
  </ul>
</article>

### Be careful using the word ‘Indigenous’

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many First Australians.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function.
Indigenous should always be capitalised.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Indigenous Specialist Officer</li>
    <li>Indigenous Services Branch</li>
  </ul>
</article>

### Writing for First Australian audiences

Remember that English can be a second, third or even fourth language for many First Australians.

Make sure of the context and relevance before using First Australian cultural terms.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First Peoples</li>
    <li>On Country</li>
    <li>Sorry Business</li>
    <li>Men’s Business</li>
    <li>Women’s Business</li>
    <li>Traditional Owners or Traditional Custodians</li>
  </ul>
