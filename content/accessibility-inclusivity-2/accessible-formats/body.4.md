#### Diagrams, graphs, charts and other complex images

A complex image needs:
- text near the image that explains why it is there and what it shows or highlights
- short alt text that briefly describes the content and is different from the caption
- text link to a page with a long text description (and possibly the associated data)

Graphs need dots, dashes and patterns, in addition to colour, to show the difference between data.

#### Long text descriptions for complex images 

A long text description is a full description of a complex image or the table of data used to generate a graph or chart.

Long text helps people who don’t understand graphs or diagrams as well as those who can’t see them.

To write long text imagine you’re describing the essential elements of a complex image in a radio interview or over the phone. Explain the important aspects, not necessarily the detail.
