  Push back on PDFs
</h2>

When we put the user first, we ask on their behalf if a PDF is really how they need to access the information. 

PDFs are not accessible on mobile devices. People need to use a desktop or laptop to use assistive technologies to read PDFs. 

It’s difficult for many users to access PDFs on smaller screens as they don’t resize and reformat to fit the screen.

### Offer an alternative format to PDF

When there is a strong evidence of a user need to have content available in PDFs, you must first publish the content in HTML. The non-HTML format is published as secondary information. 

If you are relying on PDF as the accessible format, then the document needs a HTML landing page. 

The landing page should contain an overview of the document and outcomes, as relevant. 

Provide a contact (an email address) so users can request the information in a different format.

### Make it clear you’re linking to a PDF file

Be mindful of data costs for users downloading large files (over 1MB). Downloading large files can be difficult in regional and remote places.  

Use the link to tell your users that they are downloading a PDF and how big it is.
