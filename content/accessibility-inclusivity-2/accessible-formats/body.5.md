  Create accessible videos
</h2>

Video is not just difficult for users with visual impairment. Think about:
- hearing impairment
- mobility — for example, restricted keyboard access
- flickering and moving content
- language difficulty
- the user’s environment — for example a noisy location or a workplace where the sound disturbs colleagues

### General rules for creating accessible videos 

#### Create a transcript

All videos must have transcripts for people who don’t want to watch the video, and for search engine indexing. 

Add the HTML transcript to the same page as the video. Or add a link below or beside the video to a page with the transcript.

Include all speech content and the speakers’ names.

If there is only 1 speaker you can leave out their name, unless their identity is crucial to the content.

Write relevant non-verbal information in square brackets.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Example</h4>
‘…to get to the other side [laughing].’
</article>

End the transcript with ‘End of transcript’.

#### Create closed captions 

All videos must have closed captions for people who can’t hear the dialogue and other sounds.

#### Use audio description for important visual-only information

All videos must have an audio description for people who can’t see the video that explains any important visual-only detail. 

Provide audio description for any text displayed in the video.

Use audio description to give context if it is not obvious from the title.

You don’t need audio description for dialogue delivered straight to camera (‘talking heads’).
