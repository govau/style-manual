# Choose accessible formats

<p class="componentheader__body abstract">
Plan to create accessible content from the start, whether youâ€™re writing a policy, publishing a news story, making a video or guiding users through a transaction.

Everyone involved from creation through to publishing is responsible for ensuring accessibility.
<!-- Senior executives, managers, subject matter experts, online content experts and publishing teams each play a role and should know the risks of not complying. -->

HTML is the default format for all government information. 

When choosing formats, adopt the practice of creating a web page in the first instance. 

Web content is usually published within a content management system (CMS) that has inbuilt styles that help content authors to conform with accessibility.
