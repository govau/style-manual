  Digital Service Standard (the Standard)
</h2>

If you are creating new government services or redeveloping existing services, you need to ensure they accessible to all users to meet [Criteria 9 of the Standard](#). 

Government services must be available to users regardless of their location and level of all digital confidence. This includes users in remote areas and usingâ€™ different devices. 

To meet the Standard, you need to meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)](#). 

There are 38 criteria that apply at level AA. We also recommend some of the level AAA criteria. Content authors are typically  responsible for 17 criteria (outlined in our guidance).
