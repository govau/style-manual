  Consequences and risks of non-compliance
</h2>

Government agencies that don’t meet accessibility requirements risk being reported to the [Australian Human Rights Commission](#) and attracting negative public and media attention.

The Commission investigates and resolves complaints of discrimination based on a person’s:
- [sex](#), [gender identity](#),  [intersex status](#) and [sexual orientation](#)
- [disability](#), including temporary and permanent disabilities; physical, intellectual, sensory, psychiatric disabilities, diseases or illnesses; medical conditions; work related injuries; past, present and future disabilities; and association with a person with a disability
- [race](#), including colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, immigrant status and racial hatred
- [age](#), covering young people and older people

The Commission reports on Australia’s progress against the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disability on a regular basis.

  Digital Service Standard (the Standard)
</h2>

If you are creating new government services or redeveloping existing services, you need to ensure they accessible to all users to meet [Criteria 9 of the Standard](#). 

Government services must be available to users regardless of their location and level of all digital confidence. This includes users in remote areas and using’ different devices. 

To meet the Standard, you need to meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)](#). 

There are 38 criteria that apply at level AA. We also recommend some of the level AAA criteria. Content authors are typically  responsible for 17 criteria (outlined in our guidance).
