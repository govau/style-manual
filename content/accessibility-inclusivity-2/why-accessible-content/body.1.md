Australia is a diverse country that includes people of various cultures, languages, abilities and ages. If you are creating content for government information and services, you must ensure it is accessible and inclusive.

  Benefits of accessible content
</h2>

Accessibility is a basic human right. 

<p class="au-callout">
It is against the law to be discriminated against in many areas of public life, including employment, education, the provision of goods, services and facilities, accommodation, sport and the administration of Commonwealth laws and services (Source: [Australian Human Rights Commission](#))

The people who most need government services and information often find them the hardest to understand and use. 

There are benefits to both government and society in getting it right.

### Benefits to society
Greater participation in society for: 
- people with disabilities
- people with low literacy
- older users 
- mobile device users
- people from non-English speaking backgrounds

### Benefits to government
- reduced legal risk
- financial savings (for example reduced call costs where applicable)
- demonstrating social responsibility for users
- easier translation for culturally and linguistically diverse audiences if required
- reduced legal risk of receiving complaints through the Human Rights Commission
- better search engine optimisation (plain language helps with search results)
