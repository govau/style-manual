## Many Australians use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

People use different combinations of assistive technology and adaptive strategies to use government services.

The most common assistive technologies are screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition and keyboard navigation.

### Screen readers

Screen readers are an assistive technology that helps users who are blind, visually impaired or have reading difficulties.

People use screen readers to navigate and understand web pages through a combination of:

- reading the content of the web page in a linear order
- moving around the page through headings, links and form elements
