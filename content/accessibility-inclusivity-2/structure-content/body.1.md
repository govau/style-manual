  <ul class="au-link-list">
    <li><a href="#section1">Paragraphs</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Headings and subheadings</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Hyperlinks</a></li>

<p class="componentheader__body abstract">

<h2 id="section1" class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-xl">
  Paragraphs
</h2>

Use short, simple paragraphs.

Limit paragraphs to 2 or 3 sentences containing 1 idea. Or break text up into bullet point lists.

Allow for lots of white space.

<h4>Examples</h4>

  Headings and subheadings
</h2>

The user should be able to get an understanding of the content by scanning the headings.

### Make the title short and accurate

Write a clear title and lead summary. Tell the user what the page is about and who it’s for.
Headings are the first words users read to check the relevance of content before they commit to reading it.

Make headings short and succinct enough to stand alone when read out of context, for example in search results and on social media.

Google searches only show 55 characters of the page title.

Use only 1 top level (H1) heading.

### Break up content with subheadings

Users lose track if there are too many heading levels.

Break up blocks of text and draw the reader in with short interesting headings.

Help the user to understand the relationship between sections of text.

Short content should only use 2 subheading levels (H2 and H3).

On the average web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an average visit; 20% is more likely.

### Front load keywords in headings

Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help the user to make a connection.

This will also help search engines find your content.

<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Digital communities of practice  
Smart cities in Europe  
</article>

Avoid meaningless words such as ‘more’ and ‘related information’. State what the paragraph says.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
Do this:
Smart cities in Europe
<br>
Not this:
More information
</article>
