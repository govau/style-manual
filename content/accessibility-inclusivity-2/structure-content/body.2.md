Use precise link text

Make the destination of the link clear.

Think about the user and their context when reading the information. Be helpful.

Don’t use meaningless terms such as ‘click here’, ‘read more’ or ‘useful links’.

Don’t make the link text too long. Only link the keywords.

<h4>Examples</h4>

Do this:  
Attend next month’s workshop for developers and writers in Brisbane.  
<br>
Not this:  
Attend a Brisbane workshop for developers and writers next month.  
<br>
Never this:  
Attend a Brisbane workshop for developers and writers next month.  
Click here for more information.

### Place links carefully
Add links wherever they are most useful to the user.

Embed links in paragraphs to help the user scan for the information they need.

Be careful of overcrowding paragraphs with links as this can affect readability.

Grouping links together at the bottom of a page can disrupt readability too. Users may skip the text and just read the links.

### Make calls to actions (CTAs) accurate and prominent

Use keywords the user will understand that accurately describe the action.

### Use the email address as the link

Hyperlink all email addresses.

Use the ```mailto:``` prefix in the HTMLbut not in the link text.
