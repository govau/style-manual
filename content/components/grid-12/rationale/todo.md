The grid system we use is heavily based on bootstrap. After reviewing many Australian government web-properties it was clear that the grids from bootstrap are commonly used for responsive layouts and that our users are likely to already be familiar with using it.

**Note:** we are not using the latest grid from bootstrap because it uses [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex), which is [not fully adopted by the browsers we support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox).
