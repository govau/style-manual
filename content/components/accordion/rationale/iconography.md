We settled on an up and down chevron icon, to represent our collapsible element, as opposed to a plus or minus, or arrows alternative.

This decision was made because the plus and minus could possibly indicate, and better describe, different functionality; for example, adding a dependant child to a form. While the arrows seemed more closely related to navigation.
