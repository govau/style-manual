Our checkbox and radio inputs are much larger than default browser inputs in order to provide larger hit/target areas for touchscreen devices or mobility impaired users. This was largely inspired by the work on [radios and checkboxes done by gov.uk](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/weve-updated-the-radios-and-checkboxes-on-gov-uk/).

However we also supply a small version of the inputs for use when the large inputs are impractical.
