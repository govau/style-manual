heading: ARIA alert role

We recommend only using the Page Alert component when there is important time-sensitive information that would be detrimental for a user to miss. This should also apply to assistive technology users, which is why the example HTML includes the `role="alert"`.

When used the ARIA alert role `role="alert"` will immediately interrupt assistive technology to inform users of the alert and for this reason should be used sparingly.
