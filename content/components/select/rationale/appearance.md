The design of the select box is intended to match the text-inputs and buttons used in the system. This way form elements can be combined inline.

For cross-browser constancy the default browser styles for select-boxes are removed and a background image is used for the icon. For more info see [Styling HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Styling_HTML_forms)
