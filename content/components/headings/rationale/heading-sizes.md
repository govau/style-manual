layout: component/rationale.js
heading: Heading sizes

All HTML standard heading levels are supported by the headings component when used with in `.au-body` with the [body component](/components/body/).

H1 does not use the largest font-size provided by the system `xxxl` as that size is intended for large promotions or splash-sections and is too large to be used in normal body copy.

**Note:** H1 and H6 are now supported. Previous versions of the system styled theses headings in the same way as H4, which caused confusion.
