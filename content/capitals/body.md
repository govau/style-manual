## The rule

Use capitals for official names and abbreviations (proper nouns).

Use lower case if the use of the term is:
- generic  
- not directly related to a specific name or title
- used in plural form 
- used as an adjective.

## How to apply the rules

### Government 

Capitalise the word government if you are using it as part of a formal title or abbreviated specific title.  

If not, use lower case.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>The Australian Government is responsible for … The government proposes to … This government policy will … The policy will be reviewed by the Australian Government from time to time.</p>

<p>the Victorian Government … the government</p>

<p>the Australian and New Zealand governments</p>

<p>the governments of South Australia and Tasmania</p>

<p>Sanitation is the responsibility of local government.</p>

<p>It is the function of government to …</p>
</article>

<br/>

### Commonwealth

As a federation, Australia is known as the Commonwealth of Australia. The primary governing body is the Commonwealth Parliament. Capitalise Commonwealth in this context.

If you are preparing content for  international audiences, be mindful that the word ‘Commonwealth’ is associated with the Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Empire). If you think it may cause confusion, use the word ‘Australian’ instead of ‘Commonwealth’.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Defence is a Commonwealth responsibility.</p>

<p>This question was debated at length in the Commonwealth Parliament.</p>

<p>under the Commonwealth Government’s external affairs powers.</p>
</article>

<br/>

### Federal

Capitalise the term ‘federal’ if forms part of an official title.

Do not capitalise ‘federal government’, it is a broad, descriptive term for the Commonwealth (or Australian) Government.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>the Federal Court of Australia …the Federal Court … the court</p>

<p>a federal government initiative</p>

<p>Defence is a federal responsibility.</p>
</article>

<br/>

### State and territory

Use capitals for official or abbreviated specific titles but not for generic or plural references. 

In many contexts, ‘the Territory’ has become the conventional, semi-official term for the Northern Territory. In this case capitalise it.

<br>
<article class="sm-basic-example">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>The Australian Capital Territory includes Jervis Bay. The territory’s total area is more than 2000 square kilometres.</p>

<p>The South Australian Government initiated the project … The state government will meet regularly to review progress.</p>

<p>Responsibility has been delegated to the states and territories.</p>

<p>… under federal–state arrangements.</p>
