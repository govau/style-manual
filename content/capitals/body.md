## Using capitals for terms associated with government

### The Prime Minister and Cabinet co-developed this content with the Digital Transformation Agency.  
### *The rule*

Generally, terms associated with government should capitalise the full, official name and the abbreviation of that name when it retains specific elements, but use lowercase when the abbreviation is reduced to the generic element. 

Similarly, when these terms are used generically and are not directly related to a specific name or title, and when they are in the plural or used adjectivally, they should not be capitalised. 

### Guidance of use of the term ‘Government’ 

The word government should be capitalised as part of a formal title or abbreviated specific title, but lower case is generally appropriate elsewhere.

__[example component] Examples__  
*The Australian Government is responsible for … The government proposes to … This government policy will … The policy will be reviewed by the Australian Government from time to time.*  
*the Victorian Government … the government*  
*the Australian and New Zealand governments*  
*the governments of South Australia and Tasmania*  
*Sanitation is the responsibility of local government.*  
*It is the function of government to …*  

### Guidance on use of the term ‘Commonwealth’

As a federation, Australia is known as the Commonwealth of Australia, and the primary governing body is the Commonwealth Parliament. In this context, Commonwealth is always capitalised. 

When preparing documents for an international readership, writers and editors should be mindful that the word Commonwealth is much more readily associated with the Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Empire). 

If misunderstanding might occur, it is prudent to use the word Australian instead of Commonwealth. 

__[example component] Examples__  
*Defence is a Commonwealth responsibility.*  
*This question was debated at length in the Commonwealth Parliament.*  
*under the Commonwealth Government’s external affairs powers.*  

### Guidance on use of the term ‘Federal’

The adjective ‘federal’ requires a capital only if it forms part of an official title. 

The ‘federal government’, which is a broad, descriptive term for the Commonwealth (or Australian) Government, does not need to be capitalised.

__[example component] Examples__  
*the Federal Court of Australia …the Federal Court … the court*  
*a federal government initiative*  
*Defence is a federal responsibility.*  

### Guidance on use of the states and territories 
The same general approach applies to the words ‘state’ and ‘territory’ when these refer to the jurisdictions that make up the Commonwealth of Australia: use capitals for official or abbreviated specific titles but not for generic or plural references. 

In many contexts, however, ‘the Territory’ has become the conventional, semi-official term for the Northern Territory. It thus operates as a proper name and has a capital.

__[example component] Examples__  
*The Australian Capital Territory includes Jervis Bay. The territory’s total area is more than 2000 square kilometres.*  
*The South Australian Government initiated the project … The state government will meet regularly to review progress.*  
*Responsibility has been delegated to the states and territories.*  
… *under federal–state arrangements.*
