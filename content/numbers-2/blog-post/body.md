## Leading neuroscientist tells us why digits are easier to read than words

__The Norman Nielsen Group’s Chief Research Officer, Dr John Smith says that numerals often stop the wandering eye and attract fixations, even when they're embedded within a mass of words that users otherwise ignore.__

“Why do users fixate on numerals? Because numbers represent facts, which is something users typically relish. 

“Sometimes people are looking for specific facts, such as a product's weight or size, so product pages are certainly one place where you should write numbers as numerals. 

“But even when a number doesn't represent a product attribute, it's a more compact (and thus attractive) representation of hard information than flowery verbiage,” said Dr Smith.


So how do users' eyes locate numerals while skipping past words? 

“The shape of a group of digits is sufficiently different from that of a group of letters to stand out to users' peripheral vision before their foveal vision fixates on them.

“For example the number 2,415 looks different than four even though both consist of 4 characters.
